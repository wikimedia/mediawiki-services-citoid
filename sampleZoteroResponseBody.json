Zotero offers more options for note taking than the better-known citation management system EndNote. Sixteen citation styles are available when Zotero is initially downloaded, with many more freely available. Users can install a plug-in that allows Zotero to integrate with Microsoft Word. Even though Zotero does not have an on-demand customer support service, its Web site offers a wealth of information for users. The authors highly recommend Zotero.","ISSN":"1542-4065","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","accessDate":"CURRENT_TIMESTAMP","shortTitle":"Zotero"}]
